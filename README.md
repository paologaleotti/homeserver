Personal declarative config for my home server

This repository contains the declarative configuration for my home server. It is managed using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/),
a Linux distribution that is configured declaratively using several configuration files.

The entire infrastructure uses containers and it is a single `docker-compose` file.
